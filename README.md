# AdventOfCode

Hello friends! Here are my AoC solutions, organized by year and language. Each year has it's own readme with details, but here are the summaries:
***
2021: Pythonic Python, I wanted to make my Python more elegant, and here are a few attempts
***
2022: Python vs Go vs Rust. I am primarily a Python dev at work, but I wanted to give a few compiled languages a try as well. I solved each day first with Python, and then came back to Golang and Rust afterwards, finally comparing the performance of each.
- Bonus: I recorded the compilation and runtimes for each, and made some graphs to show the performance difference
